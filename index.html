	  <h3>About WCAG Maturity Model</h3>
	  <p>ICT Accessibility within organizations of any size can be complex with multiple dimensions.  Although some organizations have individuals or departments to support accessibility, many organizations lack understanding or fail to recognize the importance of ICT accessibility as a requirement, and therefore don’t realize they need accessibility governance systems. This can result in limits to the ability to produce accessible products and associated services such as training and documentation which are essential for inclusive digital environments. The solution to this challenge is to encourage organizations to establish and implement accessibility governance systems within their organizations. These systems must integrate ICT accessibility criteria into policies, key business processes, organizational culture, and management structures in a consistent, repeatable, and measurable fashion. Only then can organizations address the complexities related to enabling ICT accessibility.</p>
	<p>This proposed WCAG Maturity Model describes an overall framework for establishing a robust ICT accessibility program and identifying areas for improvement. ​A Maturity Model is:</p>
<p>A tool;</p>
<ol>
	<li>That helps people assess the current effectiveness of a person, group, or an organization;</li>
	<li>And supports figuring out what capabilities they have and need to acquire next;</li>
	<li>In order to improve their performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Organizations know when they are doing well (or poorly) at product accessibility via audit reports and bug counts.  However, they don’t know how well they are doing as an organization to continue to produce accessible products without looking at other supporting corporate processes.  ​Maturity Modeling is a big part of a “shift-left” methodology of preventing problems from recurring, not fixing them after they have happened.</p>

​<p>Most maturity models contain some number of levels with increasing levels of maturity.  Each level contains a definition, controls, and a list of processes and evidence that must be produced for an organization to legitimately claim that they are at a particular level of maturity.</p>

<p>Maturity modeling is very different than conformance testing </p>
<ul>
<li>Conformance testing provides information about the accessibility level(s)of a particular product.  The results of a conformance test provide a picture of a particular version of a product (or a subcomponent of a product).</li>
<li>Maturity modeling provides information about the ability of an organization to produce accessible products over the long term.  The results of a maturity modeling assessment provide a holistic picture of an organization’s accessibility initiatives...where it  is doing accessibility well, and where improvements can be made that  remove barriers. </li>
</ul>
